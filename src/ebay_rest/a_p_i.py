        This method searches for eBay items by various query parameters and retrieves summaries of the items. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, charity ID, or a combination of these.Note: Only listings where FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) is a buying option are returned by default. To retrieve listings that do not have FIXED_PRICE as a buying option, the buyingOptions filter can be used to retrieve those listings.Note that an auction listing enabled with the Buy it Now feature will initially show AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE as buying options, but if/when that auction listing receives a qualifying bid, only AUCTION remains as a buying option. If this happens, the buyingOptions filter would need to be used to retrieve that auction listing.This method also supports the following:Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, refer to the filter parameter.Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item, such as item aspects (color, brand) condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter.Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter.Filtering for items that are compatible with a specific product, using the compatibility_filter parameter.Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results.For additional information and examples of these capabilities, refer to Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide.Pagination and sort controlsThere are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that are returned. By default, results are sorted by Best Match. For more information about Best Match, refer to Best Match.RestrictionsThis method can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, refer to API Restrictions.eBay Partner Network: In order to receive a commission for your sales, you must use the URL returned in the itemAffiliateWebUrl field to forward your buyer to the ebay.com site.

        :param str aspect_filter: This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item.

        :param str gtin: This field lets you search for a product by specifying a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) of the product. Supported GTIN types are UPC, EAN, and ISBN.For example:/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?gtin=099482432621Note: When constructing a query, gtin value may be combined with an epid value, but neither an epid or gtin value should be combined with a keywords search through the q parameter.
        :param str limit: The number of items from the result set returned in a single page.Note: If a value is set in the limit field, the value of offset must be either zero or a multiple of the limit value. An error is returned for invalid offset values.Note: This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items in one results set.Min: 1Max: 200Default: 50
        :param str offset: Specifies the number of items to skip in the result set. This is used with the limit field to control the pagination of the output.For example:If offset is 0 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 1-10 from the list of items returnedIf offset is 10 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 11-20 from the list of items returned.Note: The value of offset must be either zero or a multiple of the value set in the limit field. An error is returned for invalid offset values.Note: This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items in one results set.Min: 0Max: 9,999Default: 0
        :param str q: A string consisting of one or more keywords used to search for items on eBay.Note: The * wildcard character is not allowed in this field.When providing two or more keywords in a single query, the string is processed as follows:When successive keywords are separated by a space, the list of keywords is processed as an AND request. For example, to retrieve items that include both of the keywords iphone AND ipad, submit the following query:/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=iphone ipadWhen successive keywords are comma-separated and surrounded by a single pair of parentheses, OR if the keywords are each URL-encoded, the list of keywords is processed as an OR request. For example, to retrieve items that include iphone OR ipad, submit one of the following queries:/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=(iphone, ipad)/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=%28iphone%2c%20ipad%29Note: When specifying keywords using the q parameter: Do not include an epid or gtin parameter value as neither can be used in conjunction with a keyword search.Strings longer than 100-characters are truncated.Maximum length: 100 characters
        :param str sort: Specifies the criteria on which returned items are to be sorted.Items can be sorted in ascending order based on:Price (sort=price)Returned items are sorted based on their total cost (i.e., price + shipping cost).Items with the lowest combined price are shown first.When sorting by price, it is highly recommended that:The X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header is used, andThe contextualLocation parameter specifies the delivery country and postal code.These values must be URL-encoded.Refer to the following example:X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX: contextualLocation=country%3DUS%2Czip%3D19406Descending price orderTo sort items from highest price to lowest price insert a minus sign (-) before price as the search criterion:sort=-priceDistance (sort=distance)Returned items are sorted based on their distance from the buyer's location.Items that are closest to the buyer are listed first.Important! When sorting by distance, all required pickup filters must be included in the request.DateItems can be sorted by date based on:Listing date (sort=newlyListed)Returned items are sorted based on their  itemOriginDate.Newly listed items are shown first.End date (sort=endingSoonest)Returned items are sorted based on the date/time on which their listing is scheduled to end.Items that are closest to their scheduled ending date/time are shown first.If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by \"Best Match\".

        """search

        This method searches for and retrieves summaries of one or more products in the eBay catalog that match the search criteria provided by a seller. The seller can use the summaries to select the product in the eBay catalog that corresponds to the item that the seller wants to offer for sale. When a corresponding product is found and adopted by the seller, eBay will use the product information to populate the item listing. The criteria supported by search include keywords, product categories, and category aspects. To see the full details of a selected product, use the getProduct call.  In addition to product summaries, this method can also be used to identify refinements, which help you to better pinpoint the product you're looking for. A refinement consists of one or more aspect values and a count of the number of times that each value has been used in previous eBay listings. An aspect is a property (e.g. color or size) of an eBay category, used by sellers to provide details about the items they're listing. The refinement container is returned when you include the fieldGroups query parameter in the request with a value of ASPECT_REFINEMENTS or FULL.  Example A seller wants to find a product that is \"gray\" in color, but doesn't know what term the manufacturer uses for that color. It might be Silver, Brushed Nickel, Pewter, or even Grey. The returned refinement container identifies all aspects that have been used in past listings for products that match your search criteria, along with all of the values those aspects have taken, and the number of times each value was used. You can use this data to present the seller with a histogram of the values of each aspect. The seller can see which color values have been used in the past, and how frequently they have been used, and selects the most likely value or values for their product. You issue the search method again with those values in the aspect_filter parameter to narrow down the collection of products returned by the call.  Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. If you provide more than one of these parameters, they will be combined with a logical AND to further refine the returned collection of matching products.  Note: This method requires that certain special characters in the query parameters be percent-encoded:      (space) = %20       , = %2C       : = %3A       [ = %5B       ] = %5D       { = %7B       | = %7C       } = %7D  This requirement applies to all query parameter values. However, for readability, method examples and samples in this documentation will not use the encoding.  This method returns product summaries rather than the full details of the products. To retrieve the full details of a product, use the getProduct method with an ePID.

        :param str x_ebay_c_marketplace_id: This method also uses the X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID header to identify the seller's eBay marketplace. It is required for all supported marketplaces, except EBAY_US, which is the default.

Aspects are product attributes that can represent different types of information for different products. Every product has aspects, but different products have different sets of aspects.  You can determine appropriate values for the aspects by first submitting this method without this parameter. It will return either the productSummaries.aspects container, the refinement.aspectDistributions container, or both, depending on the value of the fieldgroups parameter in the request. The productSummaries.aspects container provides the category aspects and their values that are associated with each returned product. The refinement.aspectDistributions container provides information about the distribution of values of the set of category aspects associated with the specified categories. In both cases sellers can select from among the returned aspects to use with this parameter.   Note: You can also use the Taxonomy API's getItemAspectsForCategory method to retrieve detailed information about aspects and their values that are appropriate for your selected category.   The syntax for the aspect_filter parameter is as follows (on several lines for readability; categoryId is required):  aspect_filter=categoryId:category_id, aspect1:{valueA|valueB|...}, aspect2:{valueC|valueD|...},.  A matching product must be within the specified category, and it must have least one of the values identified for every specified aspect.   Note: Aspect names and values are case sensitive.   Here is an example of an aspect_filter parameter in which 9355 is the category ID, Color is an aspect of that category, and Black and White are possible values of that aspect (on several lines for readability):  GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:{White|Black}  Here is the aspect_filter with required URL encoding and a second aspect (on several lines for readability):  GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:%7BWhite%7CBlack%7D, Storage%20Capacity:%128GB%7C256GB%7D   Note: You cannot use the aspect_filter parameter in the same method with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter.  For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/commerce/catalog/types/catal:AspectFilter
        :param str category_ids:  Important: Currently, only the first category_id value is accepted.   One or more comma-separated category identifiers for narrowing down the collection of products returned by this call.   Note: This parameter requires a valid category ID value. You can use the Taxonomy API's getCategorySuggestions method to retrieve appropriate category IDs for your product based on keywords.   The syntax for this parameter is as follows:  category_ids=category_id1,category_id2,.  Here is an example of a method with the category_ids parameter:  GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? category_ids=178893   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.  If you provide only the category_ids parameter, you cannot specify a top-level (L1) category.
        :param str fieldgroups: The type of information to return in the response.   Important: This parameter may not produce valid results if you also provide more than one value for the category_ids parameter. It is recommended that you avoid using this combination.    Valid Values:   ASPECT_REFINEMENTS — This returns the refinement container, which includes the category aspect and aspect value distributions that apply to the returned products. For example, if you searched for Ford Mustang, some of the category aspects might be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, and so on.    Note: Aspects are category specific.  FULL — This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching products. This value overrides the other values, which will be ignored. MATCHING_PRODUCTS — This returns summaries for all products that match the values you provide for the q and category_ids parameters. This does not affect your use of the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS value, which you can use in the same call.  Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default:  MATCHING_PRODUCTS
        :param str gtin: A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) that identify products to search for. Currently the GTIN values can include EAN, ISBN, and UPC identifier types.   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.   You cannot use the gtin parameter in the same method with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter.
        :param str limit: The number of product summaries to return. This is the result set, a subset of the full collection of products that match the search or filter criteria of this call.  Maximum: 200  Default: 50
        :param str mpn: A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) that identify products to search for. This method will return all products that have one of the specified MPNs.  MPNs are defined by manufacturers for their own products, and are therefore certain to be unique only within a given brand. However, many MPNs do turn out to be globally unique.   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.  You cannot use the mpn parameter in the same method with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter.
        :param str offset: This parameter is reserved for internal or future use.
        :param str q: A string consisting of one or more keywords to use to search for products in the eBay catalog.   Note: This method searches the following product record fields: title, description, brand, and aspects.localizedName, which do not include product IDs. Wildcard characters (e.g. *) are not allowed.   The keywords are handled as follows:  If the keywords are separated by a comma (e.g. iPhone,256GB), the query returns products that have iPhone AND 256GB. If the keywords are separated by a space (e.g. \"iPhone ipad\" or \"iPhone, ipad\"), the query ignores any commas and returns products that have iPhone OR iPad.   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.   You cannot use the q parameter in the same method with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter.

If a video's processing fails, it could be because the file is corrupted, is too large, or its size doesn't match what was provided in the metadata. Refer to the error messages to determine the cause of the video's failure to upload.  The status message will indicate why a video was blocked from uploading.If a video is not being used on an active listing, its expiration date is automatically set to 30 days after the video's initial upload.The video's thumbnail image is automatically generated when the video is created.

        """get_traffic_report

        This method returns a report that details the user traffic received by a seller's listings. A traffic report gives sellers the ability to review how often their listings appeared on eBay, how many times their listings are viewed, and how many purchases were made. The report also returns the report's start and end dates, and the date the information was last updated.  For more information, see Traffic report details

        :param str dimension: This query parameter specifies the dimension, or \"attribute,\" that is applied to the report metric.  Valid values: DAY or LISTING Examples If you specify dimension=DAY and metric=CLICK_THROUGH_RATE, the traffic report contains the number of times an item displayed on a search results page and the buyer clicked through to the View Item page for each day in the date range, as in: 12-06-17: 32, 12-07-17: 54, ... If you specify dimension=LISTING and metric=LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE, the traffic report contains the number of times that listing appeared on the seller's store during the specified date range. For example, LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE: 157 means the item appeared 157 times in the store during the date range.If you specify dimension=LISTING without specifying any listing_ids in the parameter filter, the traffic report returned in the response contains a maximum of 200 listings.
        :param str filter: This query parameter refines the information returned in the traffic report. Note:  URL encode all the values you supply in the filter parameter. See URL encoding query parameter values as described in URL parameters.Configure the following properties of the filter parameter to tune the traffic report to your needs:  date_range Limits the report to the specified range of dates. This value can be formatted in one of two ways depending on the user's time zone.For America/Los_Angeles time zone, input the date range using YYMMDD format. As this is the default time zone used for timestamps in the report, the time zone does not need to be specified. Enclose the earliest date and end date for the report in brackets (\"[ ]\"), as follows:[YYYYMMDD..YYYYMMDD]For example:[20240101..20240131]For all other time zones, input the date range using ISO 8601 format, and specify the time zone using a UTC offset. A time zone offset is a positive or negative value that represents the number of hours a time zone is from UTC (see UTC Time Zone Converter for offset values for your time zone). Enclose the earliest date and end date for the report in brackets (\"[ ]\"), as follows:[yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS+|-hh:mm..yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS+|-hh:mm]For example:[2024-01-01T02:00:00.000-05:00..2024-01-31T02:00:00.000-05:00]Note: All time values entered in this format will be dropped, and will be replaced with 00:00:00.000 for startDate and 23:59:59.000 for endDate in the response body.The maximum range between the start and end dates is 90 days, and the earliest start date you can specify is two years prior to the current date, which is defined as 730 days (365 * 2), not accounting for Leap Year.The last date for which traffic data exists is a value called lastUpdatedDate. eBay returns an error if you specify a date range greater than 90 days, or the start date is after the lastUpdatedDate. If the specified end date is beyond the lastUpdatedDate, eBay returns data up to the lastUpdatedDate.Required: Always listing_ids This filter limits the results to only the supplied list of listingId values. Note: If you specify dimension=LISTING without specifying any listing_ids in this parameter, the traffic report returned in the response contains a maximum of 200 listings.You can specify to 200 different listingId values. Enclose the list of IDs with curly braces (\"{ }\"), and separate multiple values with a pipe character (\"|\").  This filter only returns data for listings that have been either active or sold in last 90 days, and any unsold listings in the last 30 days. All listings must be the seller's and they  must be listed on the marketplace specified by the marketplace_ids filter argument. marketplace_ids This filter limits the report to seller data related to only the specified marketplace ID (currently the filter allows only a single marketplace ID). Enclose the marketplace ID in curly braces (\"{ }\").  Valid values: EBAY_AU EBAY_DEEBAY_ESEBAY_FR EBAY_GB EBAY_ITEBAY_US EBAY_MOTORS_US Required if you set the dimension parameter to DAY. Example filter parameter The following example shows how to configure the filter parameter with the marketplace_ids and date_range filters: filter=marketplace_ids:{EBAY_US},date_range:[20170601..20170828]Encoding this portion of the query parameter sample yields: filter=marketplace_ids:%7BEBAY_US%7D,date_range:%5B20230601..20230828%5D See samples for additional examples.

        :param str metric: This query parameter specifies the metrics you want covered in the report. Note:  Unlike names for parameters and enumerated values, metric values are not case sensitive.Valid values: CLICK_THROUGH_RATE LISTING_IMPRESSION_SEARCH_RESULTS_PAGE  LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE LISTING_IMPRESSION_TOTAL LISTING_VIEWS_SOURCE_DIRECT LISTING_VIEWS_SOURCE_OFF_EBAY LISTING_VIEWS_SOURCE_OTHER_EBAY LISTING_VIEWS_SOURCE_SEARCH_RESULTS_PAGE LISTING_VIEWS_SOURCE_STORE LISTING_VIEWS_TOTAL SALES_CONVERSION_RATE TOTAL_IMPRESSION_TOTAL TRANSACTIONSpecify a comma-separated list of the metrics to include them in the report. See Using different metric parameters for more information including detailed metric descriptions and localized names.
        :param str sort: This query parameter sorts the report on the specified metric.  You can only specify a single metric in the sort parameter and the specified metric must be included in the configuration of the report's metric parameter.  Sorting is helpful when you want to review how a specific metric is performing, such as the CLICK_THROUGH_RATE.  Most reports can be sorted in ascending or descending order. Precede the value of a descending-order request with a minus sign (\"-\"), for example: sort=-CLICK_THROUGH_RATE.Note: There are a couple of constraints on sorting the report by different metrics:Sorting on the SALES_CONVERSION_RATE metric is not supportedThe TRANSACTION metric can only be sorted in the descending order (sorting in the ascending order is not supported).

        This call returns specific listing violations for the supported listing compliance types. Only one compliance type can be passed in per call, and the response will include all the listing violations for this compliance type, and listing violations are grouped together by eBay listing ID. See ComplianceTypeEnum for more information on the supported listing compliance types. This method also has pagination control.  Note: A maximum of 2000 listing violations will be returned in a result set. If the seller has more than 2000 listing violations, some/all of those listing violations must be corrected before additional listing violations will be retrieved. The user should pay attention to the total value in the response. If this value is '2000', it is possible that the seller has more than 2000 listing violations, but this field maxes out at 2000.  Note: In a future release of this API, the seller will be able to pass in a specific eBay listing ID as a query parameter to see if this specific listing has any violations.

        This method returns the details and status for an array of order tasks based on a specified feed_type or schedule_id. Specifying both feed_type and schedule_id results in an error. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (schedule_id) that returns the needed feed_type.If specifying the feed_type, limit which order tasks are returned by specifying filters such as the creation date range or period of time using look_back_days. If specifying a schedule_id, the schedule template (that the schedule_id is based on) determines which order tasks are returned (see schedule_id for additional information).

        This method returns the details and status for an array of tasks based on a specified feed_type or schedule_id. Specifying both feed_type and schedule_id results in an error. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (schedule_id) that returns the needed feed_type.If specifying the feed_type, limit which tasks are returned by specifying filters, such as the creation date range or period of time using look_back_days. Also, by specifying the feed_type, both on-demand and scheduled reports are returned.If specifying a schedule_id, the schedule template (that the schedule ID is based on) determines which tasks are returned (see schedule_id for additional information). Each scheduledId applies to one feed_type.

        :param str date_range: Specifies the range of task creation dates used to filter the results. The results are filtered to include only tasks with a creation date that is equal to this date or is within specified range. Only tasks that are less than 90 days can be retrieved.  Note: Maximum date range window size is 90 days. Valid Format (UTC):yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ..yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ For example: Tasks created on September 8, 2019 2019-09-08T00:00:00.000Z..2019-09-09T00:00:00.000Z

Only use a feedType that is available for your API: Order Feeds: LMS_ORDER_ACK, LMS_ORDER_REPORTInventory Upload Feed Types: See Available FeedTypesDo not use with the schedule_id parameter. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (schedule_id) that returns the needed feed_type.
        :param str limit: The maximum number of tasks that can be returned on each page of the paginated response.

Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0.For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves tasks 11 thru 20 from the result set.If this parameter is omitted, the default value is used. Default:  10 Maximum: 500
        :param str look_back_days: The number of previous days in which to search for tasks. Do not use with the date_range parameter. If both date_range and look_back_days are omitted, this parameter's default value is used.  Default:  7 Range:  1-90 (inclusive)
        :param str offset: The number of tasks to skip in the result set before returning the first task in the paginated response. Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. If this query parameter is not set, the default value is used and the first page of records is returned. Default: 0

Please refer to Digital Signatures for APIs to learn more on the impacted APIs and the process to create signatures to be included in the HTTP payload.The getTransactions method allows a seller to retrieve information about one or more of their monetary transactions.Note: For a complete list of transaction types, refer to TransactionTypeEnum.Numerous input filters are available which can be used individually or combined to refine the data that are returned. For example:SALE transactions for August 15, 2022;RETURN transactions for the month of January, 2021;Transactions currently in a transactionStatus equal to FUNDS_ON_HOLD.Refer to the filter field for additional information about each filter and its use.Pagination and sort query parameters are also provided that allow users to further control how monetary transactions are displayed in the response.If no monetary transactions match the input criteria, an http status code of 204 No Content is returned with no response payload. Note: Only monetary transactions that have occurred within the last five years can be retrieved.

        :param str x_ebay_c_marketplace_id: This header identifies the seller's eBay marketplace.See HTTP request headers for the marketplace ID values.Note: If a marketplace ID value is not provided, the default value of EBAY_US is used. (required)
        :param str filter: Numerous filters are available for the getTransactions method, and these filters are discussed below. One or more of these filter types can be used. If none of these filters are used, all monetary transactions occurring within the last five years are returned:transactionDate: search for monetary transactions that occurred within a specific range of dates.Note: All dates must be input using UTC format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ) and should be adjusted accordingly for the local timezone of the user.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a date range: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionDate:[2024-10-23T00:00:01.000Z..2024-11-09T00:00:01.000Z]Only payouts from the last five years can be retrieved, so make sure the starting date is less than five years in the past from the present time. Also, the maximum date range that can be specified through this date filter is 36 months, so make sure your specified date range is no more than 36 months. transactionType: search for a specific type of monetary transaction. For supported transactionType values, see TransactionTypeEnum.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a monetary transaction type: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionType:{SALE}transactionStatus: this filter type is only applicable for sales orders, and allows the user to filter seller payouts in a particular state. For supported transactionStatus values, see TransactionStatusEnum.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by transaction status: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionStatus:{PAYOUT}buyerUsername: the eBay user ID of the buyer involved in the monetary transaction. Only monetary transactions involving this buyer are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific eBay buyer: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=buyerUsername:{buyer1234} payoutId: the unique identifier of a seller payout. This value is auto-generated by eBay once the seller payout is set to be processed. Only monetary transactions involving this Payout ID are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Payout ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=payoutId:{5********8} transactionId: use this field  transactionId and also transactionType to filter for a unique identifier of a monetary transaction, or an error will occur. For a sales order, the orderId filter should be used instead. Only the monetary transaction defined by the identifier is returned.Note: This filter cannot be used alone; the transactionType must also be specified when filtering by transaction ID.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific transaction ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionId:{0*-0***0-3***3}&filter=transactionType:{SALE} orderId: the unique identifier of a sales order. Only monetary transaction(s) associated with this orderId value are returned.For any other monetary transaction, the transactionId filter should be used instead.Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific order ID:https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=orderId:{0*-0***0-3***3} payoutReference: returns the monetary transactions associated with the payoutReference. By using this ID as a filter parameter, the user will be able to track all monetary transactions associated with both sibling payouts, including sales and refunds, if any. This filter is only supported for sellers in Mainland China. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by payoutReference: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=payoutReference:{5*******3} For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/finances/types/cos:FilterField
        :param str limit: The number of monetary transactions to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output.  For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves monetary transactions 11 thru 20 from the result set.  Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0.  Maximum: 1000  Default: 20
        :param str offset: This integer value indicates the actual position that the first monetary transaction returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th monetary transaction of the result set, you would set the offset value in the request to 10. In the request, you can use the offset parameter in conjunction with the limit parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 30 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves transactions 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of transactions.  To avoid poor response time, use offset values of less than 5000.  Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0.Default: 0 (zero)
        :param str sort: By default, monetary transactions that match the input criteria are sorted in descending order according to the transaction date (i.e, most recent transactions returned first).To view transactions in ascending order instead (i.e., oldest transactions first), you would include the sort query parameter and set its value to transactionDate. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a transaction date range in ascending order:https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionDate:[2023-10-01T00:00:01.000Z..2023-10-12T00:00:01.000Z]&sort=transactionDateTransactions can only be sorted according to transaction date.

In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For example:  creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders created on or after the given timestamp. creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders created between the given timestamps, inclusive.   lastmodifieddate The time period during which qualifying orders were last modified (the orders.modifiedDate field).  In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For example:  lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders modified on or after the given timestamp. lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..2016-05-31T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders modified between the given timestamps, inclusive.  Note: If creationdate and lastmodifieddate are both included, only creationdate is used.  orderfulfillmentstatus The degree to which qualifying orders have been shipped (the orders.orderFulfillmentStatus field). In the URI, this is expressed as one of the following value combinations:  orderfulfillmentstatus:{NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders for which no shipping fulfillments have been started, plus orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not completed. orderfulfillmentstatus:{FULFILLED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders for which all shipping fulfillments have been completed, plus orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not completed.  Note: The values NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, and FULFILLED can be used in various combinations, but only the combinations shown here are currently supported.

It is possible that there can be more than one dispute filed against an order if the order has multiple line items. If this filter is used, any other filters are ignored.Use the getOrders method to retrieve order IDs. Order ID values are also shown in My eBay/Seller Hub.
        :param str buyer_username: This filter is used if the seller wishes to retrieve one or more payment disputes opened by a specific buyer. The string that is passed in to this query parameter is the eBay user ID of the buyer.

If a open_date_from field is used, but a open_date_to field is not used, the open_date_to value will default to 90 days after the date specified in the open_date_from field, or to the present time if less than 90 days in the past.The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z.

Offers in the published state are live eBay listings, and these listings will be revised with a successful bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call.An issue will occur if duplicate offerId values are passed through the same offers container, or if one or more of the specified offers are associated with different products/SKUs.Note: For multiple-variation listings, it is recommended that the bulkUpdatePriceQuantity call be used to update price and quantity information for each SKU within that multiple-variation listing instead of using createOrReplaceInventoryItem calls to update the price and quantity for each SKU. Just remember that only one SKU (one product variation) can be updated per call.

Upon first creating an inventory item record, only the SKU value in the call path is required.Important!Publish offer note: Fields may be optional or conditionally required when calling this method, but become required when publishing the offer to create an active listing. For this method, see Inventory item fields for a list of fields required to publish an offer.Note: In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all Inventory API calls, this call also requires the Content-Type and Content-Language headers. See the HTTP request headers for more information. In the case of replacing an existing inventory item record, the createOrReplaceInventoryItem call will do a complete replacement of the existing inventory item record, so all fields that are currently defined for the inventory item record are required in that update action, regardless of whether their values changed. So, when replacing/updating an inventory item record, it is advised that the seller run a getInventoryItem call to retrieve the full inventory item record and see all of its current values/settings before attempting to update the record. And if changes are made to an inventory item that is part of one or more active eBay listings, a successful call will automatically update these eBay listings. The key information that is set with the createOrReplaceInventoryItem call include:  Seller-defined SKU value for the product. Each seller product, including products within an item inventory group, must have their own SKU value. This SKU value is passed in at the end of the call URI Condition of the item Product details, including any product identifier(s), such as a UPC, ISBN, EAN, or Brand/Manufacturer Part Number pair, a product description, a product title, product/item aspects, and links to images. eBay will use any supplied eBay Product ID (ePID) or a GTIN (UPC, ISBN, or EAN) and attempt to match those identifiers to a product in the eBay Catalog, and if a product match is found, the product details for the inventory item will automatically be populated. Quantity of the inventory item that is available for purchase Package weight and dimensions, which is required if the seller will be offering calculated shipping options. The package weight will also be required if the seller will be providing flat-rate shipping services, but charging a weight surcharge.  In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the createOrReplaceInventoryItem call also requires the Content-Language header, that sets the natural language that will be used in the field values of the request payload. For US English, the code value passed in this header should be en-US. To view other supported Content-Language values, and to read more about all supported HTTP headers for eBay REST API calls, see the HTTP request headers topic in the Using eBay RESTful APIs document.For those who prefer to create or update numerous inventory item records with one call (up to 25 at a time), the bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem method can be used.

Rates have a time window in which they are \"live,\" and rates expire when their purchase window ends. If offered by the carrier, rates can include shipping options (and their associated prices), and users can add any offered shipping option to the base service should they desire.  Also, depending on the services required, rates can also include pickup and delivery windows.Note: The Logistics API only supports USPS shipping rates and labels.Each rate is for a single package and is based on the following information: The shipping origin The shipping destination The package size (weight and dimensions)  Rates are identified by a unique eBay-assigned rateId and rates are based on price points, pickup and delivery time frames, and other user requirements. Because each rate offered must be compliant with the eBay shipping program, all rates reflect eBay-negotiated prices.  The various rates returned in a shipping quote offer the user a choice from which they can choose a shipping service that best fits their needs.

        Note: As of July 8th 2024, promotions are now being referred to as discounts on Seller Hub and eBay help pages. Sell Marketing API documentation has been updated to reflect this product name change, but note that no API interface changes have been made.This method creates an item price markdown discount (know simply as a \"markdown discount\") where a discount amount is applied directly to the items included in the discount. Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights discounted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows.  Unlike an item discount, a markdown discount does not require the buyer meet a \"threshold\" before the offer takes effect. With markdown discounts, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the discount benefit. Important: There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown discounts. For details, see Discounts Manager requirements and restrictions. In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown discounts. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the Growth tab in Seller Hub. There are two ways to enable items for markdown discounts: Key-based discounts select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to discount. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to include. Rule-based discounts select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items being discounted by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions. New discounts must be created in either a DRAFT or a SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a discount and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a discount, the promotionId is returned in the Location response header. Use this ID to reference the discount in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a discount that's in a DRAFT state). Tip: Refer to Discounts Manager in the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller discounts. Markdown discounts are available on all eBay marketplaces.

Sell Marketing API documentation has been updated to reflect this product name change, but note that no API interface changes have been made.This method creates an item discount, where the buyer receives a discount when they meet the specific buying criteria. Known here as \"threshold discounts\", these discounts trigger when a threshold is met.  eBay highlights discounted items by placing teasers for the discounted items throughout the online buyer flows. Discounts are specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price of a listing, letting you offer deals such as \"Buy 1 Get 1\" and \"Buy $50, get 20% off\". Volume pricing discounts increase the value of the discount as the buyer increases the quantity they purchase. Coded Coupons provide unique codes that a buyer can use during checkout to receive a discount. The seller can specify the number of times a buyer can use the coupon and the maximum amount across all purchases that can be discounted using the coupon. The coupon code can also be made public (appearing on the seller's Offer page, search pages, the item listing, and the checkout page) or private (only on the seller's Offer page, but the seller can include the code in email and social media). Note: Coded Coupons are currently available in the US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, and AU marketplaces.There are two ways to add items to a threshold discount: Key-based discounts select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to discount. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to be discounted. Rule-based discounts select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs.

The results might not include these ad group IDs if other search conditions exclude them.Use the getAdGroups method to retrieve the ad group IDs for a seller.Required if the search results must be filtered to include negative keywords created at the ad group level.
        :param str campaign_ids: This path parameter specifies the unique eBay-assigned identifier of the ad campaign associated with the negative keywords being retrieved.This query parameter is used if the seller wants to retrieve the negative keywords from a specific campaign. The results might not include these campaign IDs if other search conditions exclude them.Note: Currently, only one campaign ID value is supported for each request. Use the getCampaigns method to retrieve campaign IDs.
        :param str limit: The number of results, from the current result set, to be returned in a single page.
        :param str negative_keyword_status: A comma-separated list of negative keyword statuses.This query parameter is used if the seller wants to filter the search results based on one or more negative keyword statuses. See NegativeKeywordStatusEnum for supported values.
        :param str offset: The number of results that will be skipped in the result set. This is used with the limit field to control the pagination of the output.For example, if the offset is set to 0 and the limit is set to 10, the method will retrieve items 1 through 10 from the list of items returned. If the offset is set to 10 and the limit is set to 10, the method will retrieve items 11 through 20 from the list of items returned.

        The find method currently returns information for a single recommendation type (AD) which contains information that sellers can use to configure Promoted Listings ad campaigns. The response from this method includes an array of the seller's listing IDs, where each element in the array contains recommendations related to the associated listing ID. For details on how to use this method, see Using the Recommendation API to help configure campaigns. The AD recommendation type  The AD type contains two sets of information: The promoteWithAd indicator The promoteWithAd response field indicates whether or not eBay recommends you place the associated listing in a Promoted Listings ad campaign. The returned value is set to either RECOMMENDED or UNDETERMINED, where RECOMMENDED identifies the listings that will benefit the most from having them included in an ad campaign. The bid percentage Also known as the \"ad rate,\" the bidPercentage field provides the current trending bid percentage of similarly promoted items in the marketplace. The ad rate is a user-specified value that indicates the level of promotion that eBay applies to the campaign across the marketplace. The value is also used to calculate the Promotion Listings fee, which is assessed to the seller if a Promoted Listings action results in the sale of an item. Configuring the request You can configure a request to review all of a seller's currently active listings, or just a subset of them. All active listings – If you leave the request body empty, the request targets all the items currently listed by the seller. Here, the response is filtered to contain only the items where promoteWithAd equals RECOMMENDED. In this case, eBay recommends that all the returned listings should be included in a Promoted Listings ad campaign. Selected listing IDs – If you populate the request body with a set of listingIds, the response contains data for all the specified listing IDs. In this scenario, the response provides you with information on listings where the promoteWithAd can be either RECOMMENDED or UNDETERMINED. The paginated response Because the response can contain many listing IDs, the findListingRecommendations method paginates the response set. You can control size of the returned pages, as well as an offset that dictates where to start the pagination, using query parameters in the request.

        :param str x_ebay_c_marketplace_id: This header specifies the eBay marketplace where you list the items for which you want to get recommendations.See HTTP Request Headers for a list of supported eBay marketplace ID values. (required)
        :param FindListingRecommendationRequest body:
        :param str filter: Provide a list of key-value pairs to specify the criteria you want to use to filter the response.  In the list, separate each filter key from its associated value with a colon (\":\").  Currently, the only supported filter value is recommendationTypes and it supports only the (\"AD\") type. Follow the recommendationTypes specifier with the filter type(s) enclosed in curly braces (\"{ }\"), and separate multiple types with commas.  Example: filter=recommendationTypes:{AD} Default: recommendationTypes:{AD}
        :param str limit: Use this query parameter to set the maximum number of ads to return on a page from the paginated response.  Default: 10 Maximum: 500
        :param str offset: Specifies the number of ads to skip in the result set before returning the first ad in the paginated response.  Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. Default: 0
