This means you will need to know when something, such as the availability, quantity, etc., has changed in any eBay item you are offering. You can do this easily by setting the  fieldgroups URI parameter. This parameter lets you control what is returned in the response. Setting  fieldgroups to COMPACT reduces the response to only those fields that you need in order to check if any item detail has changed.

ItemWebURL - The URL of the View Item page of the item. This enables you to include a \"Report Item on eBay\" link that takes the buyer to the View Item page on eBay. From there they can report any issues regarding this item to eBay. legacyItemId - The unique identifier of the eBay listing that contains the item. This is the traditional/legacy ID that is often seen in the URL of the listing View Item page. minimumPriceToBid - This container shows the minimum bid amount that would be accepted as a qualifying bid in an auction listing. This container will only be returned for auction items. price - This is tracked by the revision ID but is returned here to enable you to quickly verify the price of the item. priorityListing - This field is returned as true if the listing is part of a Promoted Listing campaign. Promoted Listings are available to Above Standard and Top Rated sellers with recent sales activity. reservePriceMet - This field indicates whether or not an auction's reserve price (if set by the seller) has been met yet. This field will only be returned for auction items.  sellerItemRevision - An identifier generated/incremented when a seller revises the item. The following are the two types of item revisions:     Seller changes, such as changing the title   eBay system changes, such as changing the quantity when an item is purchased.  This ID is changed only when the seller makes a change to the item. This means you cannot use this value to determine if the quantity has changed. To check if the quantity has changed, use  estimatedAvailabilities. shippingOptions - A container for the cost, carrier, and other details of shipping options. taxes - A container for the tax information for the item, such as the tax jurisdiction, the tax percentage, and the tax type.  topRatedBuyingExperience - A boolean value indicating if this item is a top-rated plus item. A change in the item's top rated plus standing is not tracked by the revision ID. See topRatedBuyingExperience for more information. uniqueBidderCount - This integer value indicates the number of different eBay users who have placed one or more bids on an auction item. This field is only applicable to auction items.  For Example  To check if a stored item's information is current, do following.

          This method is a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as   Shopping, and  Finding and the eBay Buy APIs. There are differences between how legacy APIs and RESTful APIs return the identifier of an \"item\" and what the item ID represents. This method lets you use the legacy item ids retrieve the details of a specific item, such as description, price, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. It also returns the RESTful item ID, which you can use with all the Buy API  methods. For more information about how to use legacy ids with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide. This method returns the item details and requires you to pass in either the item ID of a non-variation item or the item ids of both the parent and child of an item group. An item group is an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the \"parent\". All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. The  fieldgroups URI parameter lets you control what is returned in the response.

But if you also include the toy category ID, the results will be what you wanted.  For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&category_ids=220 The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces.

        :param str gtin: This field lets you search by the Global Trade Item Number of the item as defined by https://www.gtin.info. You can search only by UPC (Universal Product Code). If you have other formats of GTIN, you need to search by keyword.   For example:  /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?gtin=099482432621   Maximum:  1      Required:  The method must have  category_ids,  epid,  gtin, or  q (or any combination of these)
        :param str limit: The number of items from the result set returned in a single page. Note: If a value is set in the limit field, the value of offset must be either zero or a multiple of the limit value. An error is returned for invalid values of offset. Default: 50 Maximum number of items per page (limit): 200  Maximum number of items in a result set: 10,000
        :param str offset: Specifies the number of items to skip in the result set. This is used with the limit field to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is 0 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 1-10 from the list of items returned; if offset is 10 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 11-20 from the list of items returned. Note: The value of offset must be either zero or a multiple of the value set in the limit field. An error is returned for invalid values of offset.  Valid Values: 0-10,000 (inclusive) Default: 0 Maximum number of items returned: 10,000
        :param str q: A string consisting of one or more keywords that are used to search for items on eBay. The keywords are handled as follows:If the keywords are separated by a space, it is treated as an AND. In the following example, the query returns items that have iphone AND ipad./buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=iphone ipadIf the keywords are input using parentheses and separated by a comma, or if they are URL-encoded, it is treated as an OR. In the following examples, the query returns items that have iphone OR ipad./buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=(iphone, ipad)/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=%28iphone%2c%20ipad%29Restriction: The * wildcard character is not allowed in this field.Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these). 
        :param str sort: The order and field name that is used to sort the items. You can sort items by price, distance, or listing date. To sort in descending order, insert a hyphen (-) before the name of the sorting option. If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by "Best Match".Here are some examples showing how to use the sort query parameter:sort=distance - This sorts by distance in ascending order (shortest distance first). This sorting option is only applicable if the pickup filters are used, and only ascending order is supported.sort=-price - This sorts by price + shipping cost in descending order (highest price first). This sorting option (by price) is only guaranteed to work correctly if the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header is used, with the contextualLocation parameter being used to set the delivery country and postal code. Here is an example of how this header would be used to do this (note the URL encoding):X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX: contextualLocation=country%3DUS%2Czip%3D19406sort=newlyListed - This sorts by listing date (most recently listed/newest items first).sort=endingSoonest - This sorts by date/time the listing ends (listings nearest to end date/time first).Default: Ascending For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/browse/types/cos:SortField

        Note:   This is an experimental method that is available to select developers approved by business units. For information on how to obtain access to this API in production, see the Buy APIs Requirements. This method searches for eBay items based on a image and retrieves summaries of the items. You pass in a Base64 image in the request payload and can refine the search by category, or eBay product ID (ePID), or a combination of these using URI parameters.  To get the Base64 image string, you can use sites such as https://codebeautify.org/image-to-base64-converter. This method also supports the following:   Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more.  For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter.Filtering by item aspects using the aspect_filter parameter.   For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide.Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and  sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by "Best Match". For more information about  Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match.

        Note:   This is an experimental method that is available as a  (Limited Release) to select developers approved by business units. For information on how to obtain access to this API in production, see the Buy APIs Requirements. This method creates an eBay cart for the eBay member, if one does not exist, and adds items to that cart. Because a cart never expires, any item added to the cart will remain in the cart until it is removed.  To use this method, you must submit a RESTful item ID and the quantity of the item. If the  quantity value is greater than the number of available, the  quantity value is changed to the number available and a warning is returned. For example, if there are 15 baseballs available and you set the  quantity value to 50, the service automatically changes the value of quantity to 15.    The response returns all the items in the eBay member's cart; items added to the cart while on ebay.com as well as items added to the cart using the Browse API.   The quantity and state of an item changes often. If the item becomes \"unavailable\" such as, when the listing has ended or the item is out of stock, whether it has just been added to the cart or has been in the cart for some time, the item will be returned in the  unavailableCartItems container. Note: There are differences between how legacy APIs, such as Finding, and RESTful APIs, such as Browse, return the identifier of an \"item\" and what the item ID represents. If you have an item ID from one of the legacy APIs, you can use the legacy item ID with the  getItemByLegacyId method to retrieve the RESTful ID for that item.

        (Limited Release) This method searches for sold eBay items by various URI query parameters and retrieves the sales history of the items for the last 90 days. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, or a combination of these.     This method also supports the following:   Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more.  For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter.  Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter.  Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results.    For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controlsThere are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and  sort query parameters that  control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by "Best Match". For more information about  Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match.   URLs for this method   Production URL:  https://api.ebay.com/buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?  Sandbox URL:  https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?    Request headers You will want to use the  X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method. If you are an eBay Network Partner you  must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site .

Restrictions   For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.   

        :param str aspect_filter: This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. The results are returned in the refinement container.   For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only sold items for a woman's red or blue shirt.   /buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=shirt&category_ids=15724&aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red|Blue} To get a list of the aspects pairs and the category, which is returned in the  dominantCategoryId field, set  fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS.    /buy/marketplace_insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=shirt&category_ids=15724&fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Format:  aspectName:{value1|value2} Required:  The category ID is required twice; once as a URI parameter and as part of the  aspect_filter parameter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/marketplace_insights/types/gct:AspectFilter
        :param str category_ids: The category ID is required and is used to limit the results. For example, if you search for 'shirt' the result set will be very large. But if you also include the category ID 137084, the results will be limited to 'Men's Athletic Apparel'. For example: /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=shirt&category_ids=137084 The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site:   For the US marketplace, use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs.    Usage: This field can have one category ID or a comma separated list of IDs. You can use category_ids by itself or use it with any combination of the  gtin,  epid, and  q fields, which gives you additional control over the result set.  Restrictions:   Partners will be given a list of categories they can use.   To use a top-level (L1) category, you  must also include the  q, or  gtin, or  epid  query parameter.    Maximum number of categories: 4
        :param str epid: The ePID is the eBay product identifier of a product from the eBay product catalog. This field limits the results to only items in the specified ePID. /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?epid=241986085&category_ids=168058 You can use the product_summary/search method in the Catalog API to search for the ePID of the product.    Required:  At least 1  category_ids  Maximum:  1 epid Optional: Any combination of  epid,   gtin,  or  q
        :param str fieldgroups: This field lets you control what is to be returned in the response and accepts a comma separated list of values. The default is  MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms. For code examples see, aspect_filter.  Valid Values:    ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the  dominantCategoryId,  matchCount, and  refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for 'Mustang', some of the aspect would be  Model Year,   Exterior Color,  Vehicle Mileage, etc.   Note:  ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific.   BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions  container, which has the  matchCount and  refinementHref for  AUCTION and  FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items.  Note: Classified items are not supported.     CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in.     CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions  container, such as  NEW,  USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example,  New  can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc.   MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items.   FULL  - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items.  Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list.  Default:  MATCHING_ITEMS  
        :param str filter: This field supports multiple field filters that can be used to limit/customize the result set. The following lists the supported filters. For details and examples for all the filters, see Buy API Field Filters.     buyingOptions  conditionIds  conditions  itemLocationCountry     lastSoldDate  price  priceCurrency     The following example filters the result set by price. Note: To filter by price, price and priceCurrency must always be used together.   /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=iphone&category_ids=15724&filter=price:[50..500],priceCurrency:USD For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/marketplace_insights/types/cos:FilterField
        :param str gtin: This field lets you search by the Global Trade Item Number of the item as defined by https://www.gtin.info. This can be a UPC (Universal Product Code), EAN (European Article Number), or an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) value.        /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?gtin=241986085&category_ids=9355  Required:  At least 1  category_ids  Maximum:  1 gtin Optional: Any combination of  epid,   gtin,  or  q
        :param str limit: The number of items, from the result set, returned in a single page.   Default: 50 Maximum number of items per page (limit): 200    Maximum number of items in a result set:  10,000
        :param str offset: Specifies the number of items to skip in the result set. This is used with the  limit field to control the pagination of the output.  If  offset is 0 and  limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 1-10 from the list of items returned, if  offset is 10 and  limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 11 thru 20 from the list of items returned.   Valid Values: 0-10,000 (inclusive)   Default: 0   Maximum number of items returned:  10,000
        :param str q: A string consisting of one or more keywords that are used to search for items on eBay. The keywords are handled as follows: If the keywords are separated by a comma, it is treated as an AND. In the following example, the query returns items that have iphone  AND ipad./buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=iphone,ipad&category_ids=15724    If the keywords are separated by a space, it is treated as an OR.  In the following examples, the query returns items that have iphone  OR ipad.   /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=iphone&category_ids=15724 ipad /buy/marketplace-insights/v1_beta/item_sales/search?q=iphone, ipad&category_ids=15724    Restriction: The * wildcard character is  not allowed in this field.  Required:  At least 1  category_ids Optional: Any combination of  epid,   gtin,  or  q     
        :param str sort: This field specifies the order and the field name to use to sort the items. To sort in descending order use - before the field name.  Currently, you can only sort by price (in ascending or descending order).     If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by  "Best Match".     The following are examples of using the  sort query parameter.    SortResult&sort=price Sorts by  price in ascending order (lowest price first)&sort=-price Sorts by  price in descending order (highest price first) Default:  ascending For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/marketplace_insights/types/cos:SortField

        """search  

        This method searches for and retrieves summaries of one or more products in the eBay catalog that match the search criteria provided by a seller. The seller can use the summaries to select the product in the eBay catalog that corresponds to the item that the seller wants to offer for sale. When a corresponding product is found and adopted by the seller, eBay will use the product information to populate the item listing. The criteria supported by search include keywords, product categories, and category aspects. To see the full details of a selected product, use the getProduct call.  In addition to product summaries, this method can also be used to identify refinements, which help you to better pinpoint the product you're looking for. A refinement consists of one or more aspect values and a count of the number of times that each value has been used in previous eBay listings. An aspect is a property (e.g. color or size) of an eBay category, used by sellers to provide details about the items they're listing. The refinement container is returned when you include the fieldGroups query parameter in the request with a value of ASPECT_REFINEMENTS or FULL.  Example A seller wants to find a product that is \"gray\" in color, but doesn't know what term the manufacturer uses for that color. It might be Silver, Brushed Nickel, Pewter, or even Grey. The returned refinement container identifies all aspects that have been used in past listings for products that match your search criteria, along with all of the values those aspects have taken, and the number of times each value was used. You can use this data to present the seller with a histogram of the values of each aspect. The seller can see which color values have been used in the past, and how frequently they have been used, and selects the most likely value or values for their product. You issue the search method again with those values in the aspect_filter parameter to narrow down the collection of products returned by the call.  Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value. If you provide more than one of these parameters, they will be combined with a logical AND to further refine the returned collection of matching products.  Note: This method requires that certain special characters in the query parameters be percent-encoded:      (space) = %20       , = %2C       : = %3A       [ = %5B       ] = %5D       { = %7B       | = %7C       } = %7D  This requirement applies to all query parameter values. However, for readability, method examples and samples in this documentation will not use the encoding.  This method returns product summaries rather than the full details of the products. To retrieve the full details of a product, use the getProduct method with an ePID.  

        :param str x_ebay_c_marketplace_id: This method also uses the X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID header to identify the seller's eBay marketplace. It is required for all marketplaces except EBAY_US, which is the default. Note: This method is limited to EBAY_US, EBAY_AU, EBAY_CA, and EBAY_GB values.
        :param str aspect_filter: An eBay category and one or more aspects of that category, with the values that can be used to narrow down the collection of products returned by this call.  Aspects are product attributes that can represent different types of information for different products. Every product has aspects, but different products have different sets of aspects.  You can determine appropriate values for the aspects by first submitting this method without this parameter. It will return either the productSummaries.aspects container, the refinement.aspectDistributions container, or both, depending on the value of the fieldgroups parameter in the request. The productSummaries.aspects container provides the category aspects and their values that are associated with each returned product. The refinement.aspectDistributions container provides information about the distribution of values of the set of category aspects associated with the specified categories. In both cases sellers can select from among the returned aspects to use with this parameter.   Note: You can also use the Taxonomy API's getItemAspectsForCategory method to retrieve detailed information about aspects and their values that are appropriate for your selected category.   The syntax for the aspect_filter parameter is as follows (on several lines for readability; categoryId is required):  aspect_filter=categoryId:category_id, aspect1:{valueA|valueB|...}, aspect2:{valueC|valueD|...},.  A matching product must be within the specified category, and it must have least one of the values identified for every specified aspect.   Note: Aspect names and values are case sensitive.   Here is an example of an aspect_filter parameter in which 9355 is the category ID, Color is an aspect of that category, and Black and White are possible values of that aspect (on several lines for readability):  GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:{White|Black}  Here is the aspect_filter with required URL encoding and a second aspect (on several lines for readability):  GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? aspect_filter=categoryId:9355,Color:%7BWhite%7CBlack%7D, Storage%20Capacity:%128GB%7C256GB%7D   Note: You cannot use the aspect_filter parameter in the same method with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter.  For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/commerce/catalog/types/catal:AspectFilter
        :param str category_ids:  Important: Currently, only the first category_id value is accepted.   One or more comma-separated category identifiers for narrowing down the collection of products returned by this call.   Note: This parameter requires a valid category ID value. You can use the Taxonomy API's getCategorySuggestions method to retrieve appropriate category IDs for your product based on keywords.   The syntax for this parameter is as follows:  category_ids=category_id1,category_id2,.  Here is an example of a method with the category_ids parameter: br /> GET https://api.ebay.com/commerce/catalog/v1_beta/product_summary/search? category_ids=178893   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.  If you provide only the category_ids parameter, you cannot specify a top-level (L1) category. 
        :param str fieldgroups: The type of information to return in the response.   Important: This parameter may not produce valid results if you also provide more than one value for the category_ids parameter. It is recommended that you avoid using this combination.    Valid Values:   ASPECT_REFINEMENTS — This returns the refinement container, which includes the category aspect and aspect value distributions that apply to the returned products. For example, if you searched for Ford Mustang, some of the category aspects might be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, and so on.    Note: Aspects are category specific.  FULL — This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching products. This value overrides the other values, which will be ignored. MATCHING_PRODUCTS — This returns summaries for all products that match the values you provide for the q and category_ids parameters. This does not affect your use of the ASPECT_REFINEMENTS value, which you can use in the same call.  Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default:  MATCHING_PRODUCTS
        :param str gtin: A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) that identify products to search for. Currently the GTIN values can include EAN, ISBN, and UPC identifier types.   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.   You cannot use the gtin parameter in the same method with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter. 
        :param str limit: The number of product summaries to return. This is the result set, a subset of the full collection of products that match the search or filter criteria of this call.  Maximum: 200  Default: 50
        :param str mpn: A string consisting of one or more comma-separated Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) that identify products to search for. This method will return all products that have one of the specified MPNs.  MPNs are defined by manufacturers for their own products, and are therefore certain to be unique only within a given brand. However, many MPNs do turn out to be globally unique.   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.  You cannot use the mpn parameter in the same method with either the q parameter or the aspect_filter parameter. 
        :param str offset: This parameter is reserved for internal or future use.
        :param str q: A string consisting of one or more keywords to use to search for products in the eBay catalog.   Note: This method searches the following product record fields: title, description, brand, and aspects.localizedName, which do not include product IDs. Wildcard characters (e.g. *) are not allowed.   The keywords are handled as follows:  If the keywords are separated by a comma (e.g. iPhone,256GB), the query returns products that have iPhone AND 256GB. If the keywords are separated by a space (e.g. \"iPhone ipad\" or \"iPhone, ipad\"), the query ignores any commas and returns products that have iPhone OR iPad.   Note: Although all query parameters are optional, this method must include at least the q parameter, or the category_ids, gtin, or mpn parameter with a valid value.   You cannot use the q parameter in the same method with either the gtin parameter or the mpn parameter.

The report also returns the report's start and end dates, and the date the information was last updated. When using this call: Be sure to URL-encode the values you pass in query parameters, as described in URI parameters. See the request samples below for details. You can only specify a single metric in the sort parameter and the specified metric must be listed in the metric parameter of your request. Parameter names are case sensitive, but metric names are not. For example, the following are correct: sort=LISTING_IMPRESSION_TOTAL sort=listing_impression_total metric=listing_impression_total However, these are incorrect: SORT=LISTING_IMPRESSION_TOTAL SORT=listing_impression_total Metric=listing_impression_total For more information, see Traffic report details.

If you specify dimension=LISTING and metric=LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE, the traffic report contains the number of times that listing appeared on the seller's store during the specified date range. For example, LISTING_IMPRESSION_STORE: 157 means the item appeared 157 times in the store during the date range.

The last date for which traffic data exists is a value called lastUpdatedDate. eBay returns an error if you specify a date range greater than 90 days, or the start date is after the lastUpdatedDate.

        This call returns specific listing violations for the supported listing compliance types. Only one compliance type can be passed in per call, and the response will include all the listing violations for this compliance type, and listing violations are grouped together by eBay listing ID. See ComplianceTypeEnum for more information on the supported listing compliance types. This method also has pagination control. Note: A maximum of 2000 listing violations will be returned in a result set. If the seller has more than 2000 listing violations, some/all of those listing violations must be corrected before additional listing violations will be retrieved. The user should pay attention to the total value in the response. If this value is '2000', it is possible that the seller has more than 2000 listing violations, but this field maxes out at 2000. Note: In a future release of this API, the seller will be able to pass in a specific eBay listing ID as a query parameter to see if this specific listing has any violations. Note: Only mocked non-compliant listing data will be returned for this call in the Sandbox environment, and not specific to the seller. However, the user can still use this mock data to experiment with the compliance type filters and pagination control.

Supported values for this header can be found in the MarketplaceIdEnum type definition.

        :param str compliance_type: A seller uses this query parameter to retrieve listing violations of a specific compliance type. Only one compliance type value should be passed in here. See ComplianceTypeEnum for more information on the compliance types that can be passed in here. If the listing_id query parameter is used, the compliance_type query parameter {if passed in) will be ignored. This is because all of a listing's policy violations {each compliance type) will be returned if a listing_id is provided. Either the listing_id or a compliance_type query parameter must be used, and if the seller only wants to view listing violations of a specific compliance type, both of these parameters can be used. Note: The listing_id query parameter is not yet available for use, so the seller does not have the ability to retrieve listing violations for one or more specific listings. Until the listing_id query parameter becomes available, the compliance_type query parameter is required with each getListingViolations call.
        :param str offset: The integer value input into this field controls the first listing violation in the result set that will be displayed at the top of the response. The offset and limit query parameters are used to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves listing violations 11 thru 20 from the resulting set of violations. Note: This feature employs a zero-based index, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If the listing_id parameter is included in the request, this parameter will be ignored. Default: 0 {zero)
        :param str listing_id: Note: This query parameter is not yet supported for the Compliance API. Please note that until this query parameter becomes available, the compliance_type query parameter is required with each getListingViolations call. This query parameter is used if the user wants to view all listing violations for one or more eBay listings. The string value passed into this field is the unique identifier of the listing, sometimes referred to as the Item ID. Either the listing_id or a compliance_type query parameter must be used, and if the seller only wants to view listing violations of a specific compliance type, both of these parameters can be used. Up to 50 listing IDs can be specified with this query parameter, and each unique listing ID is separated with a comma.
        :param str limit: This query parameter is used if the user wants to set a limit on the number of listing violations that are returned on one page of the result set. This parameter is used in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves listing violations 11 thru 20 from the collection of listing violations that match the value set in the compliance_type parameter. Note: This feature employs a zero-based index, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If the listing_id parameter is included in the request, this parameter will be ignored.

In order to use this filter, the payoutStatus filter must also be used and its value must be set to RETRYABLE_FAILED. The date format to use is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ. The same syntax used for the payoutDate filter is also used for the lastAttemptedPayoutDate filter. This filter is only applicable (and will return results) if one or more seller payouts have failed, but are retryable. payoutStatus: search for payouts in a particular state. Only one payout state can be specified with this filter. The supported payoutStatus values are as follows:INITIATED: search for payouts that have been initiated but not processed.SUCCEEDED: search for successful payouts.RETRYABLE_FAILED: search for payouts that failed, but ones which will be tried again. This value must be used if filtering by lastAttemptedPayoutDate. TERMINAL_FAILED: search for payouts that failed, and ones that will not be tried again.

        :param str limit: The number of payouts to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output.  For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves payouts 11 thru 20 from the result set.  Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first payout in the results set has an offset value of 0.   Maximum: 200  Default: 20
        :param str offset: This integer value indicates the actual position that the first payout returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th payout of the result set, you would set the offset value in the request to 10. In the request, you can use the offset parameter in conjunction with the limit parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 30 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves payouts 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of payouts.  Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first payout in the results set has an offset value of 0.Default: 0 (zero)
        :param str sort: By default, payouts or failed payouts that match the input criteria are sorted in ascending order according to the payout date/last attempted payout date (oldest payouts returned first). To view payouts in descending order instead (most recent payouts/attempted payouts first), you would include the sort query parameter, and then set the value of its field parameter to payoutDate or lastAttemptedPayoutDate (if searching for failed, retryable payouts).

The returned Order objects contain information you can use to create and process fulfillments, including:  Information about the buyer and seller Information about the order's line items The plans for packaging, addressing and shipping the order The status of payment, packaging, addressing, and shipping the order A summary of monetary amounts specific to the order such as pricing, payments, and shipping costs A summary of applied taxes and fees, and optionally a breakdown of each   Important: In this call, the cancelStatus.cancelRequests array is returned but is always empty. Use the getOrder call instead, which returns this array fully populated with information about any cancellation requests.  

        :param str field_groups: The response type associated with the order. The only presently supported value is TAX_BREAKDOWN. This type returns a breakdown of tax and fee values associated with the order.
        :param str filter: One or more comma-separated criteria for narrowing down the collection of orders returned by this call. These criteria correspond to specific fields in the response payload. Multiple filter criteria combine to further restrict the results.  Note: Currently, filter returns data from only the last 90 days. If the orderIds parameter is included in the request, the filter parameter will be ignored.  The available criteria are as follows:  creationdate The time period during which qualifying orders were created (the orders.creationDate field). In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For example:  creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders created on or after the given timestamp. creationdate:[2016-02-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders created between the given timestamps, inclusive.   lastmodifieddate The time period during which qualifying orders were last modified (the orders.modifiedDate field).  In the URI, this is expressed as a starting timestamp, with or without an ending timestamp (in brackets). The timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, which uses the 24-hour Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) clock.For example:  lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..] identifies orders modified on or after the given timestamp. lastmodifieddate:[2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..2016-05-31T08:25:43.511Z] identifies orders modified between the given timestamps, inclusive.  Note: If creationdate and lastmodifieddate are both included, only creationdate is used.  orderfulfillmentstatus The degree to which qualifying orders have been shipped (the orders.orderFulfillmentStatus field). In the URI, this is expressed as one of the following value combinations:  orderfulfillmentstatus:{NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders for which no shipping fulfillments have been started, plus orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not completed. orderfulfillmentstatus:{FULFILLED|IN_PROGRESS} specifies orders for which all shipping fulfillments have been completed, plus orders for which at least one shipping fulfillment has been started but not completed.  Note: The values NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, and FULFILLED can be used in various combinations, but only the combinations shown here are currently supported.   Here is an example of a getOrders call using all of these filters:  GET https://api.ebay.com/sell/v1/order?filter=creationdate:%5B2016-03-21T08:25:43.511Z..2016-04-21T08:25:43.511Z%5D,lastmodifieddate:%5B2016-05-15T08:25:43.511Z..%5D,orderfulfillmentstatus:%7BNOT_STARTED%7CIN_PROGRESS%7D  Note: This call requires that certain special characters in the URI query string be percent-encoded:      [ = %5B       ] = %5D       { = %7B       | = %7C       } = %7D  This query filter example uses these codes. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/fulfillment/types/api:FilterField
        :param str limit: The number of orders to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the call retrieves orders 11 thru 20 from the result set.  If a limit is not set, the limit defaults to 50 and returns up to 50 orders. If a requested limit is more than 200, the call fails and returns an error. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If the orderIds parameter is included in the request, this parameter will be ignored.  Maximum: 200  Default: 50
        :param str offset: Specifies the number of orders to skip in the result set before returning the first order in the paginated response.  Combine offset with the limit query parameter to control the items returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the first page of the response contains the first 10 items from the complete list of items retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 20, the first page of the response contains items 11-30 from the complete result set. Default: 0
        :param str order_ids: A comma-separated list of the unique identifiers of the orders to retrieve (maximum 50). If one or more order ID values are specified through the orderIds query parameter, all other query parameters will be ignored.

Before using this call for a given package, you must determine which line items are in the package. If the package has been shipped, you should provide the date of shipment in the request. If not provided, it will default to the current date and time.

In order to create and publish an offer (and create an eBay listing), a seller must have at least one inventory location, as every offer must be associated with a location.Upon first creating an inventory location, only a seller-defined location identifier and a physical location is required, and once set, these values can not be changed. The unique identifier value (merchantLocationKey) is passed in at the end of the call URI. This merchantLocationKey value will be used in other Inventory Location calls to identify the inventory location to perform an action against.At this time, location types are either warehouse or store. Warehouse locations are used for traditional shipping, and store locations are generally used by US merchants selling products through the In-Store Pickup program, or used by UK, Australian, and German merchants selling products through the Click and Collect program. A full address is required for store inventory locations. However, for warehouse inventory locations, a full street address is not needed, but the city, state/province, and country of the location must be provided. Note that all inventory locations are \"enabled\" by default when they are created, and you must specifically disable them (by passing in a value of DISABLED in the merchantLocationStatus field) if you want them to be set to the disabled state. The seller's inventory cannot be loaded to inventory locations in the disabled state. In addition to the authorization header, which is required for all eBay REST API calls, the following table includes another request header that is mandatory for the createInventoryLocation call, and two other request headers that are optional:   Header Description Required? Applicable Values   Accept Describes the response encoding, as required by the caller. Currently, the interfaces require payloads formatted in JSON, and JSON is the default. No application/json   Content-Language Use this header to control the language that is used for any returned errors or warnings in the call response. No en-US   Content-Type The MIME type of the body of the request. Must be JSON.

You can set the autoSelectFutureInventory request field to true so that after your campaign launches, eBay will regularly assess your new, revised, or newly-eligible listings to determine whether any should be added or removed from your campaign according to the rules you set. If there are, eBay will add or remove them automatically on a daily basis. Key-based campaigns – Add items to an existing campaign using either listing ID values or Inventory Reference values: Add listingId values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByListingID or bulkCreateAdsByListingId. Add inventoryReference values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByInventoryReference or bulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference.Add an ad group to an existing campaign by calling createAdGroup.Note: No matter how you add items to a Promoted Listings campaign, each campaign can contain ads for a maximum of 50,000 items. If a rules-based campaign identifies more than 50,000 items, ads are created for only the first 50,000 items identified by the specified criteria, and ads are not created for the remaining items. Creating a campaign To create a basic campaign, supply: The user-defined campaign name The start date (and optionally the end date) of the campaign The eBay marketplace on which the campaign is hosted Details on the campaign funding model The campaign funding model specifies how the Promoted Listings fee is calculated. Currently, the supported funding models are COST_PER_SALE and COST_PER_CLICK. For complete information on how the fee is calculated and when it applies, see Promoted Listings fees. If you populate the campaignCriterion object in your createCampaign request, campaign \"ads\" are created by \"rule\" for the listings that meet the criteria you specify, and these ads are associated with the newly created campaign. For details on creating Promoted Listings campaigns and how to select the items to be included in your campaigns, see Promoted Listings campaign creation.

        This method creates an item price markdown promotion (know simply as a \"markdown promotion\") where a discount amount is applied directly to the items included the promotion. Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows.  Unlike an item promotion, a markdown promotion does not require the buyer meet a \"threshold\" before the offer takes effect. With markdown promotions, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the promotion benefit. Important: There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown promotions. For details, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions. In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown promotions. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the Growth tab in Seller Hub. There are two ways to add items to markdown promotions: Key-based promotions select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to include the promotion. Rule-based promotions select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions. New promotions must be created in either a DRAFT or a SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the Location response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a promotion that's in a DRAFT state). Tip: Refer to Promotions Manager in the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller promotions. Markdown promotions are available on all eBay marketplaces. For more information, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions.

Known here as \"threshold promotions\", these promotions trigger when a threshold is met.  eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the promoted items throughout the online buyer flows. Discounts are specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price of a listing, letting you offer deals such as \"Buy 1 Get 1\" and \"Buy $50, get 20% off\". Volume pricing promotions increase the value of the discount as the buyer increases the quantity they purchase. Coded Coupons provide unique codes that a buyer can use during checkout to receive a discount. The seller can specify the number of times a buyer can use the coupon and the maximum amount across all purchases that can be discounted using the coupon. The coupon code can also be made public (appearing on the seller's Offer page, search pages, the item listing, and the checkout page) or private (only on the seller's Offer page, but the seller can include the code in email and social media). Note: Coded Coupons are currently available in the US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, and AU marketplaces.There are two ways to add items to a threshold promotion: Key-based promotions select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote.

The response from this method includes an array of the seller's listing IDs, where each element in the array contains recommendations related to the associated listing ID. For details on how to use this method, see Using the Recommendation API to help configure campaigns. The AD recommendation type The AD type contains two sets of information: The promoteWithAd indicator The promoteWithAd response field indicates whether or not eBay recommends you place the associated listing in a Promoted Listings ad campaign. The returned value is set to either RECOMMENDED or UNDETERMINED, where RECOMMENDED identifies the listings that will benefit the most from having them included in an ad campaign. The bid percentage Also known as the "ad rate," the bidPercentage field provides the current trending bid percentage of similarly promoted items in the marketplace. The ad rate is a user-specified value that indicates the level of promotion that eBay applies to the campaign across the marketplace. The value is also used to calculate the Promotion Listings fee, which is assessed to the seller if a Promoted Listings action results in the sale of an item. Configuring the request You can configure a request to review all of a seller's currently active listings, or just a subset of them. All active listings – If you leave the request body empty, the request targets all the items currently listed by the seller. Here, the response is filtered to contain only the items where promoteWithAd equals RECOMMENDED. In this case, eBay recommends that all the returned listings should be included in a Promoted Listings ad campaign. Selected listing IDs – If you populate the request body with a set of listingIds, the response contains data for all the specified listing IDs. In this scenario, the response provides you with information on listings where the promoteWithAd can be either RECOMMENDED or UNDETERMINED. The paginated response Because the response can contain many listing IDs, the findListingRecommendations method paginates the response set. You can control size of the returned pages, as well as an offset that dictates where to start the pagination, using query parameters in the request.
