These results include an HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of each listing migration, the SKU value associated with each item, and if the migration is successful, an Offer ID value. The SKU value will be used in the Inventory API to manage the Inventory Item object, and the Offer ID value will be used in the Inventory API to manage the Offer object.
