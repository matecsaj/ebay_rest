        This required container is used to assign individual inventory items to the inventory item group. Multiple SKU values are passed in to this container. If updating an existing inventory item group, the seller should make sure that all member SKU values are passed in, as long as the seller wants that SKU to remain in the group.<br><br>It is also possible to add or remove SKUs with a <strong>createOrReplaceInventoryItemGroup</strong> call. If the seller wants to remove a SKU from the group, that seller will just omit that SKU value from this container to remove that inventory item/SKU from the inventory item group and any published, multiple-variation listing. However, a variation cannot be removed from the group if that variation has one or more sales for that listing. A workaround for this is to set that variation's quantity to <code>0</code> and it will be 'grayed out' in the View Item page.<br><br>This container is always returned.  # noqa: E501
