        The title of an inventory item can be added or modified with a createOrReplaceInventoryItem call. Although not immediately required, a title will be needed before an offer with the inventory item is published. The title of an inventory item is automatically populated if the seller specifies an eBay Product ID (ePID) or a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and eBay is able to find a matching product in the eBay Catalog. If the inventory item will become part of a single-variation offer, and the listing is not a product-based listing, the text in this field will become the actual listing title for the published offer. However, if the inventory item will become part of a multiple-variation offer, the text in title field of the inventory item group entity will actually become the listing title for the published offer instead, although a title can still be provided for the inventory item, and it will actually become the title of the variation. This field will always be returned for an inventory item that is part of a published offer since a published offer will always have a listing title, but this field will only be returned if defined for inventory items that are not a part of a published offer.
