    Marketing API

    <p>The <i>Marketing API </i> offers two platforms that sellers can use to promote and advertise their products:</p> <ul><li><b>Promoted Listings</b> is an eBay ad service that lets sellers set up <i>ad campaigns </i> for the products they want to promote. eBay displays the ads in search results and in other marketing modules as <b>SPONSORED</b> listings. If an item in a Promoted Listings campaign sells, the seller is assessed a Promoted Listings fee, which is a seller-specified percentage applied to the sales price. For complete details, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promoted-listings.html\">Promoted Listings</a>.</li>  <li><b>Promotions Manager</b> gives sellers a way to offer discounts on specific items as a way to attract buyers to their inventory. Sellers can set up discounts (such as \"20% off\" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion <i>teasers</i> throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html\">Promotions Manager</a>.</li></ul>  <p><b>Marketing reports</b>, on both the Promoted Listings and Promotions Manager platforms, give sellers information that shows the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. The data gives sellers the ability to review and fine tune their marketing efforts.</p> <p class=\"tablenote\"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must have an active eBay Store subscription, and they must accept the <b>Terms and Conditions</b> before they can make requests to these APIs in the Production environment. There are also site-specific listings requirements and restrictions associated with these marketing tools, as listed in the \"requirements and restrictions\" sections for <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PL-requirements\">Promoted Listings</a> and <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements\">Promotions Manager</a>.</p> <p>The table below lists all the Marketing API calls grouped by resource.</p>  # noqa: E501

        This method creates a report task, which generates a Promoted Listings report based on the values specified in the call. The report is generated based on the criteria you specify, including the report type, the report's dimensions and metrics, the report's start and end dates, the listings to include in the report, and more. Metrics are the quantitative measurements in the report while dimensions specify the attributes of the data included in the reports. When creating a report task, you can specify the items you want included in the report. The items you specify, using either listingId or inventoryReference values, must be in a Promoted Listings campaign for them to be included in the report. For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see Creating Promoted Listings reports. This call returns the URL to the report task in the Location response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID. Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of 202, which indicates the report is being generated. Call getReportTasks (or getReportTask with the report-task ID) to determine the status of a Promoted Listings report. When a report is complete, eBay sets its status to SUCCESS and you can download it using the URL returned in the reportHref field of the getReportTask call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file extension of .tsv.gz. Note: This call fails if you don't submit all the required fields for the specified report type.

For example, if you supply an offset of 0 and a limit of 10, the response contains the first 10 reports from the complete list of report tasks retrieved by the call. If offset is 10 and limit is 10, the first page of the response contains reports 11-20 from the complete result set. Default: 0
        :param str report_task_statuses: This parameter filters the returned report tasks by their status. Supply a comma-separated list of the report statuses you want returned. The results are filtered to include only the report statuses you specify. Note: The results might not include some report tasks if other search conditions exclude them. Valid values: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PENDING &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUCCESS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAILED
        :return: ReportTaskPagedCollection
                 If the method is called asynchronously,
                 returns the request thread.
